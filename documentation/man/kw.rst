SYNOPSIS
========
*kw* *<command>* [<option> ...]

DESCRIPTION
===========
**kw** mission is: reduce the overhead related with infrastructure project
setup in projects that have a similar workflow to the Linux Kernel. It can (and
should) be customized by editing the **kworkflow.config** file, as discussed in
section `ABOUT kworflow.config`_.

COMMANDS
========
**kw** offers several subcommands catering to different audiences and targeting
different functionality groups. Most subcommands have sane defaults.

COMMANDS FOR USING QEMU
-----------------------
Projects that use a QEMU VM in the development cycle to host the development
environment usually require that developers use some specific commands to
manage this VM. In this section, you can find all commands available in **kw**
to manage many daily tasks related to QEMU VM operation. Notice that some
rules are specific for the Linux Kernel project.

  | :ref:`kw-umount<umount-doc>`
  | :ref:`kw-up<up-doc>`

COMMANDS FOR DEPLOY NEW KERNEL IMAGE AND MODULE
-----------------------------------------------
When we develop for Linux Kernel, we continuously want to install/update the
current version of the Kernel image or modules, and this tasks may require
several steps to be accomplished. For this reason, **kw** provides an option
named **deploy** that handles attempts to handle all the complexity related to
the new Kernel installation. It is essential to highlight that we try to
support three different types of deploy: *local*, *vm*, and *remote*. When you
want to update your host machine, you can use the *local* option; if you're
going to deploy your new kernel in the VM, you can use *vm* option. Finally, we
provide the *remote* option, which is much more flexible since it uses network;
notice that this approach is the most generic one because you can use it for
*vm* and *local*.

COMMANDS FOR WORKING WITH CODE
------------------------------
Projects that have a similar workflow to the Linux Kernel usually have a set of
tools that simplify part of the tasks related with the code. This section
describes some of the key features supported by **kw** to help with code.

  | :ref:`kw-codestyle<codestyle-doc>`
  | :ref:`kw-explore<explore-doc>`
  | :ref:`kw-maintainers<maintainers-doc>`

SUBSYSTEM COMMANDS
------------------

Linux kernel has multiple subsystems that expose operations via sysfs or
provide mechanisms for userspace to interact with the driver. For this reason,
kw offers some options that target some specific subsystems for providing
facilities for users to interact with a particular subsystem. Currently, we
only support drm.

OTHER COMMANDS
--------------

This section describes a tool available in **kw** to help developers keep track
of configuration files and other features provided by **kw** that do not fit in
the previous sections.

ABOUT kworflow.config
=====================
.. _`ABOUT kworkflow.config`:

**kw** reads its configuration from two files: the global
*<path>/etc/kworkflow.config* file and the local **kworkflow.config** file
present at the current working directory. The global **kworkflow.config** is a
part of the **kw** code and provides the overall behavior for **kw**. Local
**kworkflow.config** settings override global ones; you may have one
**kworkflow.config** per project. In this section, we describe the possible
fields you can specify in the configuration files.

ssh_user=USER
-------------
Sets the user to be used by ssh. By default **kw** uses **root**.

ssh_ip=IP
---------
Sets the IP address to be used by ssh. By default **kw** uses **localhost**.

ssh_port=PORT
-------------
Sets the ssh port. By default **kw** uses 2222.

ssh_configfile=SSH_CONFIGURATION_FILE
-------------------------------------
Provides an optional SSH configuration file to be used by ssh. For more details see `man ssh_config`.

hostname=HOSTNAME
-----------------
Sets the hostname to be used when an SSH configuration file is provided.

arch=ARCHITECTURE
-----------------
Allows you to specify the default architecture used by **kw**. By default,
**kw** uses x86_64.

kernel_img_name=KERNEL_IMAGE_NAME
---------------------------------
Use this option as a way to indicate to kw the kernel image name. This is the
file present in the directory `arch/*/boot/`; keep in mind that the kernel
image name might change based on the user config file or target architecture.

cross_compile=CROSS_COMPILE_TOOLCHAIN_NAME
------------------------------------------
Kw supports cross compile setup, use this option to indicate the target
toolchain.

menu_config=MENU_OPTION
-----------------------
Default kernel menu used by kw.

virtualizer=VIRTUALIZER
-----------------------
Defines the virtualization tool that should be used by kw. Currently, we only
support QEMU and, as a result, the default is **qemu-system-x86_64**

mount_point=PATH
----------------
Defines the kw mount point, which will be used by libguestfs during the
mount/umount operation of a VM. By default, **kw** uses /home/$USER/p/mount.

qemu_hw_options=OPTIONS
-----------------------
Sets QEMU options. By default, **kw** uses
**-enable-kvm -daemonize -smp 2 -m 1024**

qemu_net_options=OPTIONS
------------------------
Defines the network configuration. By default, **kw** uses
**-nic user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,smb=/home/USERKW**

qemu_path_image=PATH
--------------------
Specify the VM image path. By default, **kw** uses
**/home/USERKW/p/virty.qcow2**

alert=[vs|s|v|n]
----------------
Default alert options, you have:

1. v: enables visual notification.

2. s enables sound notification.

3. vs or sv enables both.

4. n (or any other option) disables notifications.

sound_alert_command=COMMAND
---------------------------
Command to run for sound completion alert. By default, **kw** uses
**paplay INSTALLPATH/sounds/complete.wav &**

visual_alert_command=COMMAND
----------------------------
Command to run for visual completion alert. By default, **kw** uses
notify-send -i checkbox -t 10000 "kw" "Command: \\"$COMMAND\\" completed!"
(Note: You may use COMMAND, which will be replaced by the kw command
whose conclusion the user wished to be alerted.)

default_deploy_target
---------------------
By default, **kw** deploys in the VM; however, you can change this behavior
with this variable. The available options are: vm, local, and remote.

reboot_remote_by_default
------------------------
Reboot machine after the deploy finish

gui_on=COMMAND
--------------
This option is disabled by default, if enabled, it requires a command that
instructs kw to turn on the GUI.

gui_off=COMMAND
---------------
This option is disabled by default, if enabled, it requires a command that
instructs kw to turn off the GUI.

EXAMPLE
=======
For these examples, we suppose the fields in your *kworkflow.config* file is
already configured.

First, if you are working in a specific kernel module, and if you want to
install your recent changes in your VM you can use::

    cd /KERNEL/PATH
    kw d --vm --modules

.. note::
   Turn off your VM before use the *intall* command.

For building and installing a new module version based on the current kernel
version, you can use::

  cd /KERNEL/PATH
  kw bd

For checking the code style::

  cd /KERNEL/PATH
  kw c drivers/iio/dummy/
  kw c drivers/iio/dummy/iio_simple_dummy.c

If you want to check the maintainers::

  cd /KERNEL/PATH
  kw m drivers/iio/dummy/iio_simple_dummy.c

In case you want that kw saves your current .config file, you can use::

    cd /KERNEL/PATH
    kw g --save my_current_config

You can see the config's file maintained by kw with::

  kw g --list

You can turn on your VM with::

  kw u

After you start your VM you can ssh into it with::

  kw s -c="dmesg -wH"
  kw s

You can see data related to your kw usage by using the statistics option, see
some examples below::

  kw statistics --day
  kw statistics --week
  kw statistics --month
  kw statistics --year

You can also request a specific day, week, month, or year. For example::

  kw statistics --day 2020/05/12
  kw statistics --week 2020/02/29
  kw statistics --month 2020/04
  kw statistics --year 1984

If you are working with DRM drivers, you can take advantage of load and unload
commands combined with GUI control commands. For example::

  kw drm --load-module='amdgpu' --gui-on # Load a driver and trigger the user GUI
  kw drm --unload-module='amdgpu' # Turn off user GUI and unload the driver

.. note::
   You have to wait for the sshd to become ready.
