SYNOPSIS
========
*kw* (*u* | *up*)

DESCRIPTION
===========
Projects that use a QEMU VM in the development cycle to host the development
environment usually require that developers use some specific commands to
manage this VM. This explains the `up` command available in **kw**.

This starts the QEMU VM based on parameters in the **kworkflow.config** file.
